# Chapter 1 Lesson 2 - Exploring the Flow Blockchain & Cadence

Welcome back to Lesson 2! In this lesson, we will delve into the Flow Blockchain and understand why we have chosen to focus on it for building our DApp. We'll also touch upon Cadence, the Smart Contract programming language for Flow.

## The Flow Blockchain - A Brief Introduction

The Flow Blockchain is our platform of choice and for good reason. Let's take a closer look at its background and key features.

### A Historical Perspective

Flow Blockchain gained prominence around the Summer of 2020 when the Flow team introduced it to the public, sparking considerable interest. Dapper Labs, the company behind Flow, previously created the popular CryptoKitties DApp, which enjoyed immense popularity and became one of the first widely adopted blockchain applications.

Dapper Labs' experience with CryptoKitties on Ethereum led them to identify certain challenges with Ethereum and Solidity (the primary Smart Contract language for many blockchains on the Ethereum Virtual Machine). To address these issues, Dapper Labs developed Cadence, the custom Smart Contract programming language for Flow.

### Highlights of Flow

Here are some important characteristics that set Flow apart:

1. **Cost-effectiveness**: Compared to Ethereum, Flow is substantially cheaper for performing actions on the blockchain. Ethereum transactions can cost around $80, while Flow transactions cost fractions of a cent. This cost advantage makes Flow a more accessible platform for developing production-level DApps.

2. **Emerging Platform**: As a relatively new blockchain, Flow is continually evolving and improving. While this means there may be occasional bugs, it also presents an excellent opportunity to learn and utilize Flow and Cadence.

3. **Learning Resources**: As Flow is relatively new, learning resources may be scarce. This course aims to bridge that gap by providing comprehensive guidance on developing iOS Mobile DApps with Flow and Cadence.

4. **Success Stories**: Flow has already witnessed successful DApps like NBATopShot, which achieved significant popularity and recognition.

## Cadence - The Smart Contract Language for Flow

Cadence is the designated Smart Contract programming language for the Flow Blockchain. It is the language we will use to write the Smart Contracts in this course.

While this lesson won't delve deep into the intricacies of Cadence (as this is not a beginner Cadence course), we will use Cadence throughout this boot camp to build our DApp on the Flow Blockchain.

> If you wish to gain a better understanding of Cadence, consider exploring our [Beginner Cadence Course](https://academy.ecdao.org/en/catalog/courses/beginner-cadence), which offers comprehensive insights into this language.

## Conclusion

That concludes Chapter 1! In the next chapter, we will begin our journey by creating our very first DApp.

## Quests

No quests for today, but don't get too comfortable! Prepare yourself for the upcoming chapters where we'll delve deeper into practical hands-on exercises.
