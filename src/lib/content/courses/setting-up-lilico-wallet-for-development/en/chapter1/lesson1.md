# Chapter 1 Lesson 1 - Download & Setup Lilico Wallet

Since the FCL-Swift SDK does not work with the Flow dev wallet, it's important to ensure you have a wallet capable of supporting multiple accounts and that those accounts have been funded on the Flow testnet. Unfunded testnet accounts will often run into storage capacity errors when attempting to interact with the blockchain.

## Download Lilico Wallet

Start by downloading [Lilico](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lilico/id1644169603) from the App Store.

## Open & Create Account

After Lilico finishes downloading, open the app and press Skip to continue past the info pages. After that you will need to accept the Legal Information, then pick your username.

## Setup Developer Mode

Once your account has been created, we need to enable Developer Mode to access our testnet account. Head to the "Settings" tab (it's the 'profile' icon in the bottom right corner of the screen) then click on "Developer Mode". On the next screen press the toggle to enable Developer Mode and select "Testnet". You can now navigate back to the main account page, once there you should see a green "TESTNET" badge next to your account name in the upper right corner of the screen.
